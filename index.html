    Hello, I'm Scott. I'm a self-taught programmer, computer science student,
    and software engineering intern at IBM.

    <p>
    When I was in high school I started playing with Linux and teaching myself
    how to program. One thing led to another, and now I use Linux for
    almost everything and I've been programming
    <a href="/projects.html">open-source software</a> in my spare time ever
    since.

    <p>
    My main interests are programming language design and implementation,
    which lead me to learn various diverse and obscure languages, and I've
    created a few languages of my own, which you can see on my
    <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> page.

    <p>
    In the summer of 2013 I received an
    <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">NSERC</a> scholarship enabling me
    to work as an undergraduate research assistant in the
    <a href="http://hci.usask.ca">Interaction Lab</a>.

    <p>
    This past summer I interned at Google in Waterloo, Ontario for 4 months. In
    autumn I began my current 12 month internship with IBM's C++ compiler team
    in Markham, Ontario. In autumn of 2015 I'll finally get back to university
    to finish my last year of classes.

    <p>
    Apart from programming, my hobbies include reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27001981-scott">books</a>, listening to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/sco50000">music</a>, and collecting <a href="http://www.discogs.com/user/tsion/collection">vinyl records</a>.
