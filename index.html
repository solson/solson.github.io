    Hello, I'm Scott. I'm a self-taught programmer, computer science student, and
    research assistant at the University of Saskatchewan.

    <p>
    I'm currently in the third year of a four-year computer science bachelor's
    degree. This past summer I received an
    <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">NSERC</a> scholarship enabling me
    to work as an undergraduate research assistant in the
    <a href="http://hci.usask.ca">Interaction Lab</a>.
