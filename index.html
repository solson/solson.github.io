    Hello, I'm Scott. I'm a self-taught programmer, computer science student,
    and research assistant at the University of Saskatchewan.

    <p>
    I'm currently in the third year of a computer science bachelor's degree.
    This past summer I received an
    <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">NSERC</a> scholarship enabling me
    to work as an undergraduate research assistant in the
    <a href="http://hci.usask.ca">Interaction Lab</a>.

    <p>
    In high school I started messing around with Linux and teaching myself how
    to program... One thing led to another, and now I use Arch Linux almost
    exclusively and I've been programming
    <a href="/projects.html">open-source software</a> in my spare time ever since.

    <p>
    My main passion is programming language design and implementation, which
    has lead me to learn various diverse and obscure languages, and I've
    created a few languages of my own, which you can see
    <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.

    <p>
    Besides programming, I love to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27001981-scott">read books</a>, listen to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/sco50000">music</a>, and collect <a href="http://www.discogs.com/user/tsion/collection">vinyl records</a>.
