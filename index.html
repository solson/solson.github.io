<p class="lead">
Hello, I'm Scott. I'm a self-taught programmer, computer science student, and
research assistant at the University of Saskatchewan.

<p>
I'm currently in the third year of a four-year computer science bachelor's
degree. This past summer I received an
<a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">NSERC</a> award enabling me to work as
an undergraduate research assistant in the
<a href="http://hci.usask.ca">Interaction Lab</a>.
