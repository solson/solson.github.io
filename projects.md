### [FastTap](http://github.com/tsion/FastTap) <small>Android (Summer 2013)</small>
_University of Saskatchewan Human-Computer Interaction Lab project_

* Developed an experimental Android painting application designed to study
  an innovative form of command selection for tablets, incorporating design
  requirements from the other authors of the research paper
* Guided research participants through the study to generate the essential
  data for the paper
* [Research paper](/FastTap.pdf) accepted at the CHI conference \[[video](http://youtu.be/1Yz-qQ8RA5g)\]

### [Pinta CommandMap](http://github.com/tsion/Pinta) <small>C# (Summer 2013)</small>
_University of Saskatchewan Human-Computer Interaction Lab project_

* Modified an open-source image editor, [Pinta](http://pinta-project.com), to
  incorporate an experimental user interface known as a CommandMap, similar to
  the one in [this
  paper](http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/andrew.cockburn/papers/commandMap-finalCamera.pdf)
* The CommandMap shows all of the buttons of the UI in a semi-transparent
  overlay when a certain hotkey is held down
* Human spatial memory makes command selection significantly faster over time
  compared to current interface designs
