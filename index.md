Hello, I'm Scott. I'm a self-taught programmer, computer science student, and
software engineering intern at IBM.

When I was in high school I started playing with Linux and teaching myself how
to program. One thing led to another, and now I use Linux for almost everything
and I've been programming [open-source software](/projects.html) in my spare
time ever since.

My main interests are programming language design and implementation, which lead
me to learn various diverse and obscure languages, and I've created a few
languages of my own, which you can see on my [projects](/projects.html) page.

In the summer of 2013 I received an [NSERC](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca)
scholarship enabling me to work as an undergraduate research assistant in the
[Interaction Lab](http://hci.usask.ca).

This past summer I interned at Google in Waterloo, Ontario for 4 months. In
autumn I began my current 12 month internship with IBM's C++ compiler team in
Markham, Ontario. In autumn of 2015 I'll finally get back to university to
finish my last year of classes.

Apart from programming, my hobbies include
reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27001981-scott),
listening to [music](http://www.last.fm/user/sco50000),
and collecting [vinyl records](http://www.discogs.com/user/tsion/collection).
