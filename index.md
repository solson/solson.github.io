Hello, I'm Scott.
I'm a self-taught programmer
and a computer science student
at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.

I'm an avid learner of all things computer-related,
but I am particularly interested
in programming language theory and implementation,
as well as programmer tools in general.
I've learned many different programming languages
and created a few of my own,
which you can see on my [projects][projects] page.

I recently finished a 4 month internship at Google
followed by a 12 month internship on IBM's C++ compiler front-end team.
I am currently finishing up the final year of my CS degree
while working part-time in the [Interaction Lab][hci].

Apart from programming, my hobbies include
reading [books][goodreads],
listening to [music][lastfm],
and collecting [vinyl records][discogs].
